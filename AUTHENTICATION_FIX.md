# ✅ Authentication Fix for Safe Context

## 🔧 **Problem Fixed:**

The SafeContext was trying to load safe state before user authentication, causing 401 Unauthorized errors.

## 🛠️ **Changes Made:**

### 1. **SafeContext Authentication Integration:**

- ✅ Added `useAuth()` hook to check authentication state
- ✅ Only loads safe state when user is authenticated
- ✅ Added authentication checks to all safe operations
- ✅ Better error handling for 401 errors

### 2. **Updated Methods:**

- ✅ `loadSafeState()` - waits for authentication
- ✅ `refreshSafeState()` - checks authentication before refresh
- ✅ `addFunding()` - requires authenticated user
- ✅ `deductForInvoice()` - requires authenticated user

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### Step 1: Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Reset Database (Optional)

Connect to PostgreSQL and run:

```sql
\i database/reset-all-data.sql
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication Flow

1. **Open frontend** - Safe should NOT load (user not logged in)
2. **Login** - Safe state should load automatically after login
3. **Check console** - Should see:
   ```
   ⏳ Waiting for authentication before loading safe state...
   🔄 Loading safe state from database for authenticated user...
   ✅ Safe state loaded from database: [data]
   ```

### Step 4: Test Safe Operations

1. **Add Funding** - Should work with authenticated user
2. **Create Invoice** - Should deduct from safe properly
3. **Logout** - Safe operations should be disabled

## 🔍 **Expected Console Messages:**

### Before Login:

```
⏳ Waiting for authentication before loading safe state...
```

### After Login:

```
🔄 Loading safe state from database for authenticated user...
✅ Safe state loaded from database: { current_balance: 0, total_funded: 0, total_spent: 0, transactions: [] }
```

### During Operations:

```
💰 Adding funding to database: { amount: 100000, description: "Test funding" }
✅ Funding added successfully
✅ Safe state refreshed from database
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

The authentication issue is now fixed. The Safe will only load when the user is properly authenticated, eliminating the 401 errors.
